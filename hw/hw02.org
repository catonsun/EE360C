1. *Truthfulness in Stable Marriage*

   A preference list exists such that a woman can lie and acheive a
   better outcome. Such a list is as follows:

   | m_1: | (w_a, w_b, w_c) |  | w_a: | (m_2, m_1, m_3) |
   | m_2: | (w_b, w_a, w_c) |  | w_b: | (m_1, m_2, m_3) |
   | m_3: | (w_a, w_b, w_c) |  | w_c: | (m_1, m_2, m_3) |
   
   Normally, this would result in the set:
   
   \begin{equation}
   \{ (m_1, w_a), (m_2, w_b), (m_3, w_3) \}
   \end{equation}
   
   However, w_a can claim (m_2, m_3, m_1), resulting in the set: 
   
   \begin{equation}
   \{ (m_1, w_b), (m_2, w_a), (m_3, w_c) \}
   \end{equation}

   The set of stable marriages contains the pair $(m_2, w_a)$, which is
   $w_a$ first choice of partner.

2. *Running Times*

   With 10^12 ops / sec, we can run \gamma = 3.6 * 10^15 ops / hour.

   a. $n = \sqrt{\gamma} = 6 * 10^7$

   b. $n = \sqrt[6]{\gamma} = 391$

   c. $n = \sqrt{\gamma / 5555} = 10801$

   d. $n = 60855$

   e. $n = \log_2{\gamma} = 51$

3. *Efficiency*

   a. A_1

   b. A_2

   c. A_1

   d. A_2

   e. A_1
