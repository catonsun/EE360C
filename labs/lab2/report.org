* Proofs
** GPSR is non-optimal
We will show that GPSR is non-optimal by counter example. Assume that
we have found a path using GPSR. Such a path must have a first node,
that was closest to the sink. It is possible to construct a graph such
that the first node leads the GPSR algorithm along a sub-optimal path
because of the initial decision to follow the closest node.

** Dijkstra Min-Hops is better, but non-optimal
Using Dijkstra's algorithm without regard for weight between nodes
will provide a result similar to GPSR, but completely disregard all
latency requirements. It is simple to construct a graph containing an
obvious shortest path (in terms of hops), but terribly in-efficient
with regard to latency. We can construct such a graph by initially
setting all weights to 1, running Dijkstra's algorithm (min-hop), and
then modifying the weights of all nodes in the path to have an
extremely high latency. Such a graph will return the same path with
a min-hop metric, but return a much more efficient path using a
min-latency metric.

* Efficiency Analysis
** Memory Efficiency of Graph
The data structure used for this lab consists of a map of vertices
to a map of verticies to edges. In essence, each vertex holds a map
with keys for each neighbor within the transmission range. The space
complexity of this representation is $O(V * E)$.

** Runtime Complexity of Graph
Creating the data structure is rather fast as it only requires
examining each edge in the graph. The runtime complexity of creation
is $O(E)$.

** Runtime Complexity of Dijkstra
The data structure used within Dijkstra's algorithm allows $O(1)$
lookup of neighbors by allowing us to search for an edge between to
vertices. Therefore, the overall runtime complexity of Dijkstra's
algorithm is $O(V^2)$. Worst-case, the algorithm will examine the
metric between every pair of nodes because we do not use a priority
queue in our algorithm.

* Runtime Efficiency

The graph below displays the runtime of our three algorithms:

GPSR (blue), Dijkstra Min-Latency (green), and Dijkstra Min-Hops (red).

The success rate of all algorithms was 100% for all tested
transmission ranges in the large input testcase.
